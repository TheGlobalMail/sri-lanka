Gnanaseelan stands near his five-year-old son Rajani, who lost his lower arm and his mother, when she was killed while breastfeeding and shielding him during a 2009 attack in Sri Lanka’s northeast. Rajani sits on the lap of his grandmother,  Indra Devi, and next to his cousin.	</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>His name is Gnanaseelan. He’s 32. He’s a Tamil, though never a Tiger. A father. A widower.</p>
<p>He lives in this desperate shanty outside the seaside hamlet of Mullaitivu, on Sri Lanka’s war-ravaged northeast coast, with nine relatives, six of them motherless children.</p>
<p>Gnanaseelan is an itinerant, unskilled labourer, taking a day’s work when he can find one, which isn’t that often. The Sinhalese contractors building new roads around here for the government in faraway Colombo prefer their labour muscle to be able-bodied.</p>
<p>When seeking work, Gnanaseelan keeps his war wound to himself. Few will hire Gnanaseelan because of his leg injuries sustained when he and his refugee family became cannon fodder in the last days of Sri Lanka’s civil war, which ended in May 2009 on a blood-soaked spit of sand about 3km from here.</p>
<p>The rare times he does snare a job, he’s paid around 1,000 rupees a day, about $US7.50, and a rice and curry meal if the employer is feeling generous.</p>
<p>Though Gnanaseelan – and thousands like him – is a victim of Sri Lanka’s nasty ethnic politics, in pre-election KevinRuddspeak he’d journey only as far as Papua New Guinea should he somehow gather the minimum $5,000 it costs to be smuggled onto a rickety Australia-bound boat in perilous search of sanctuary, away from all this misery.</p>
<p>Unsurprising then, that there’s a fatalistic saying here among a people who’ve suffered so much tragedy – 30 years under the misrule of the neo-Stalinist Tigers, a calamitous civil war, the 10-metre-high tsunami that surged through here in 2004, the end-of-war bombardment of 2008-09, and now the menacing Sinhalese military – that ‘the dead are lucky’, because they don’t have to live like this.</p>

Indra Devi with Rajani on her knee, and his cousin standing close, sees the plight of the Tamils as ‘fate’.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>That’s five year-old Rajani sitting on the knee of his Gnanaseelan’s mother-in-law, Indra Devi. He may well be an asylum seeker too. A skittish boy, Rajani suckles and clings to his aaya, his maternal grandmother, as a newborn kitten does its mother.</p>
<p>As you can see, Rajani doesn’t have a lower left arm. It was blown off when he was just one year old and not even walking. It was severed in that same shelling attack that injured his father, the same shelling that killed Rajani’s mother Asintha, then 26 years old, “a beautiful woman” as her husband and mother remember her, but not Rajani.</p>
<p>Indra Devi recalls how, in early 2009, they evacuated to a bunker on that now notorious killing field called Mullivaikal, as the Sri Lankan military swept through their village. Asintha was breastfeeding Rajani when a shell struck the shelter, blasting her from behind. The mortar ripped her body apart, killing her instantly and severing Rajani’s left arm.</p>
<p>This nightmare continued for months as thousands of innocent Tamil families like them were stranded between the last stronghold of the Tigers’ ruthless leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran and surging government forces desperate to kill him.</p>
<p>Indra Devi says more than 2,000 Tamil civilians were exposed in the immediate area around their bunker. Gnanaseelan thinks there were about 150,000 people massed onto that narrow sandspit.</p>
<p>Asintha was one of eight people who died from that single shell. Indra Devi doesn’t know which side’s shells struck them because “both were fighting”. Then the shelling stopped and Gnanaseelan, Indra Devi and little armless Rajani could leave. They spent months being screened and ‘de-Tigerised’ in massive government camps before being allowed back to their devastated village, where this modest shack was built with foreign aid. Four years on, Indra Devi regards her family’s desperate plight as “fate.”</p>
<p>THE rare times Gnanaseelan does leave his family, he passes by his neighbour’s home, another Sri Lankan Tamil who could be an asylum seeker.</p>

RAVI CHANDRAN sits outside his house, nervous that Sri Lankan army intelligence, operating in a nearby camp, will find out he’s been talking to foreigners and intimidate him, or worse. 
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>His name is Ravi Chandran, and what you can’t see from this photograph are his two prosthetic limbs, which replaced his own legs blown off at Mullivaikal.</p>
<p>A Christian charity provided 35-year-old Ravi his prostheses, which might make him doubly suspicious before fanatics like the Bodu Bala Sena, the militant Buddhist monks patronised by the government that wants to set up shop here. (LINK HERE TO EARLIER STORY) The BBS isn’t favourably disposed to anyone who isn’t Sinhalese or Buddhist. The Christians do-gooders built Ravi the rudimentary house he and his family moved to last year, but couldn’t provide water, sanitation or power - responsibilities the Colombo government hasn’t yet fulfilled.</p>
<p>No Tiger either, legless Ravi is even less able employable than his neighbour Gnanaseelan. He makes a few rupees selling eggs from the chooks clucking about his plot. Ravi is scared, and doesn’t want us to hang around because he says Sri Lankan army intelligence, with a camp near here, will find out he’s been talking to suddos, as foreigners are known in Sinhala slang, and intimidate him or worse, simply because they can and do here. He didn’t ask us to visit him, and he’s genuinely worried now that we’re here. He allows us to quickly photograph him if it will help get him that coveted fresh water well.</p>
<p>About a kilometre from here, by the main road that connects Mullaitivu to Colombo 340 km away, an Australian government billboard has toppled over. It one of the 41 signs that Australian taxpayers have paid to erect up this way, its purpose to discourage Tamils like Gnanaseelan and Ravi from coming to Australia. The number of Sri Lankans getting on illegal boats has jumped about 25-fold since the war ended. But with an Australian election looming, a poll inevitably  fought on the asylum issue, Canberra has gotten tougher. This week, a new “no visa” campaign across Sri Lankan print, radio and television has been launched to break the smugglers.</p>

The Australian government has splurged on billboards warning Sri Lankans against seeking asylum by boat, but the steady procession of boats leaving from beaches here suggests it’s money poorly spent. These are desperate people who “have no faith in what the hell is going on where they are”.
    </p>

<p>But the steady procession of boats leaving from beaches along here that has vote-hunters like Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott so exercised suggests it’s money poorly spent.</p>
<p>In a land of desperate people, people smuggling is a lucrative trade, and its no certainty that Rudd’s ‘PNG solution’ will much change things. As Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu of the Colombo-based thinktank says “its not really about where people are going, it’s what they are wanting to leave.”</p>
<p>“You are talking about people, call them political refugees, call them economic refugees, the bottom line is they have no faith in what the hell is going on where they are, and they obviously feel the grass is greener on the other side,” he says.</p>
<p>“It’s an indictment on the government policy, that economic development is the panacea for reconciliation and that everything is more or less hunky dory in the north, and in particular that’s not the case.”</p>
<p>The Global Mail asked Renuka Marshall of TBWA-TAL, the Colombo advertising agency that designed them for Australia’s Customs and Border Protection Service, about their efficacy. She was warned off by Canberra from speaking, saying she had to refer our questions to the ACBPS, which responded in Canberraspeak; “the Australian Government is committed to providing people in Sri Lanka with up to date information on Australian Government policy in this area.”</p>
<p>We saw five of Marshall’s signs on our travels through the Tamil region and, at the very least, the billboards remaining erect provide shady relief from the scorching tropical sun for the local cops soliciting pagawa (bribes).</p>
<p>Perhaps Canberra’s cash could be better spent ‘providing up to date information’ to military brass at Trincomallee, where the Sri Lankan Navy has a big base and training academy and at military headquarters in Colombo, ruled by one of President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s brothers, Gotabaya.</p>
<p>Gota, as he’s known, is the regime’s much-feared enforcer. http://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/psychiatric-disorder-an-analysis-of-gotabaya-rajapaksa/ But he has some image problems up here, not least the widespread perception that the military is rotten, and possibly his relatives as well. It doesn’t take long traversing this coast to hear persistent rumours of official involvement in people smuggling, of the navy sailing the other way as another refugee boat hits the high seas.</p>
<p>Whilst in the North-East, we heard myriad stories of precarious passages to Indonesia and beyond, of 200 people cramming into a fishing boat built for 20, of berths costing as much as $US10,000 per passenger and paid to shady agents with government and military connections.</p>
<p>The CPA’s Dr Saravanamuttu says the waters of the north-east are now so tightly controlled, it’s almost inconceivable for an unofficial vessel to leave Sri Lanka. “You cannot get out of territorial waters without the navy letting you out,” he says. “It just can’t be done.”</p>
<p>Indeed, there are suspicions that the boat convoys like a proverbial spigot, to be turned on and off by officials in Colombo at their political whim, a valve that engages whenever tiny Sri Lanka wants to punch above its international weight, and send a back-off message to Australia should it dare criticise Colombo.</p>
<p>Which might explain why successive Australian administrations, unlike their Western counterparts in Washington, the United Nations, Ottawa and across Europe, have been reluctant to point fingers at the Rajapaksas’ handling of the war and their half-hearted reconciliation with its Tamil community.</p>
<p>In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out attending the CHOGM summit in protest, while Britain’s deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told the House of Commons there will be "consequences" for Sri Lanka if "despicable human rights violations" were not addressed by the Rajapaksa regime.As a Tamil leader in Trincomallee put it, “our people aren’t getting on a boat for Canada or the UK, they are heading for Australia, and the government here knows there’s soon going to be an election there.”</p>
<p>“Australia has behaved in a peculiar fashion,” says Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu of the independent Colombo thinktank, the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA). “The government here is very much aware of what the pressing election issues are in Australia.”</p>
<p>A smooth CHOGM is essential to the Rajapaksas, says the CPA’s Dr Saravanamuttu, because “they can show they are not international pariahs and that the international community endorses them.”</p>
<p>And Australia seems anxious to help. One diplomatic insider in Colombo told The Global Mail how, during his visit to Sri Lanka last December, Australia’s Foreign Minister Bob Carr was ‘told in no uncertain terms what havoc the Rajapaksas could wreak on Australia if it wanted to.”</p>
<p>The CPA’s Dr Saravanamuttu has been picking up the same message. “When Carr came here, I think he was told directly or indirectly that the numbers could increase,” he says.</p>
<p>Since Carr’s visit, a succession of Australian officials such as shadow foreign minister Julie Bishop, shadow immigration minister Scott Morrison and shadows border protection minister Michael Keenan have made sanitised tours of Sri Lanka, coming away in furious agreement “that since the end of the war things have been vastly improving.” http://www.abc.net.au/insiders/content/2012/s3746725.htm</p>
<p>Which is not how Tamils who live here, like Jaffna lawyer and civil society activist Kumaravadivel Guruparan of the Forum for Social Empowerment, see it.</p>
<p>Guruparan believes the Sinhalese government in Colombo is undertaking “structural genocide” among his fellow Tamils in a “very well-calculated generational plan….to de-Tamilise the community.”</p>
<p>“The government’s plan post-war is to make sure the Tamils become a negligible minority,” he says, “So that the things that identify Tamils as a collective are eliminated.”</p>
<p>He says Tamils are being constantly intimidated and harrassed by authorities. Guruparan says military land grabs and the general social conditions of Tamils in the four years since the war ended are “definitely worse than the 1970s,” the tumultuous period that gave rise to the Tigers and Tamil militancy.</p>
<p>“None of this was present in the 1970’s,” says the 28 year-old Guruparan, an Oxford-educated lawyer. “There was never an army presence like this. My parents say they weren’t exposed to the army as much as I have been.”</p>
<p>A TAMIL politician hands us this map of the Jaffna peninsula, Sri Lanka’s Tamil heartland.</p>

	<p>JAFFNA MAP CAPTION HERE</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“This is the reason why Tamils are getting on boats,” he says. “They are stealing their property.”</p>
<p>The map purports to illustrate how much land has been taken over for ‘security reasons’ by the mostly Sinhalese military, around 20 per cent of the region. Tamil activists say more than 100,000 Tamils have been displaced since the war ended, adding to the estimated 150,000 displaced by fighting during the 26 year-long conflict and who still live in refugee shanties around Jaffna. It also shows the military bases that have sprung up, at least 60 of them through the area.</p>
<p>“There is one army soldier for every 11 people here,” says Jaffna lawyer and civil society activist Kumaravadivel Guruparan of the Forum for Social Empowerment.</p>
<p>We send the map to Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka’s Defence Secretary and mastermind of the military victory over the Tigers, for comment but he does not respond. The military presence is sensitive, and its clear the locals are not subdued. This week, Colombo announced it was shutting 13 army camps around Jaffna and returning the land to their original owners who, it insisted, had been paid rent while the sites were occupied. The army claimed the move had nothing to do with provincial elections scheduled for next month, the first in 25 years, that are expected to be swept by the opposition Tamil National Alliance.</p>
<p>The military’s biggest ‘high security zone’ is north of Jaffna around the town of Kankesanturai, stretching along 30 kms of coast and six kms inland. This is the part of the island’s far north that’s closest to India, the regional superpower. Tamil sources have told us the Rajapaksas are secretly building a lavish ‘official residence’ here, close to Palaly, Jaffna’s seldom-used airport. They say the President will fly Commonwealth leaders here for a retreat during the November CHOGM, to show off “the crowning glory of the Sinhalese victory in the war.”</p>
<p>The Global Mail bluffs its way into the heavily-armed HSZ. Restricted where we could move, we don’t see any lavish presidential piles under construction but we do visit a military-owned beach resort that shows Sri Lanka’s soldiers are also keen for their share of the post-war economic spoils. Little wonder, perhaps, that under Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Ministry of Defence is now combined with the country’s Urban Development Authority - soldiers as property developers.</p>
<p>Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu of the CPA thinktank says his research indicates that of 19 brigades in the Sri Lankan army, 16 are now stationed in the north-east. That means there are more than 100,000 troops stationed in the mostly Tamil Jaffna Peninsula and adjacent Vanni region, with its combined population of around 1.3 million, one of the highest soldier-to-civilian ratios in the world.</p>
<p>The government’s plan, says the Jaffna academic Guruparan, is more ‘Chinese in Tibet’ than the Israeli efforts to re-settle the mostly Occupied Territories. It starts with a massive ‘land grab’ underway in the region by the mostly Sinhalese military. On the coast north of Jaffna, Guruparan says the military has seized 6000 acres of property since the war under the banner of ‘national security.’ He says the military is settling down soldiers and their families “to become a more normalised part of the population over generations.”</p>
<p>He talks of Sri Lankan soldiers being ordered to marry female ex-members of the LTTE, and describes one woman he has legally represented, a former civilian administrator in the Tigers’ civil service when this area - around 15 per cent of the island’s landmass - was their de facto state, Eelam.</p>
<p>The woman’s husband was a ranking commander in the Tiger navy, the Sea Tigers, who died in battle in 2008.  Since the war ended a year later, Guruparan says she has been constantly harrassed by army agents. “She was told that for her to lead a secure life, she would have to re-marry an army soldier,” he says.</p>
<p>“These are the kind of subtle ways in which Sinhala Buddhists, these extremists, this hegemony, is taking place…what I call the normalisation of abnormalcy,” he says. “This is what the government means by ‘time and space’ and ‘reconciliation’.” He says such examples are now being taught in school seminars in former LTTE-controlled areas to illustrate what ‘reconciliation’ means.</p>
<p>Such talk does not go over well among the Rajapaksas in Colombo. As an articulate advocate in middle-class Tamil civil society circles, Oxford-educated Guruparan says he is also harassed, and his vice-chancellor at the state-funded University of Jaffna warned by military intelligence about his activism.</p>
<p>Guruparan says the government is suspicious of anyone who had any sort of contact with the Tigers. In the north-east, that means just about everybody, because they were the administration here for decades, forcibly conscripting soldiers from everyday families, often at the threat of death. “There is no family who doesn’t know someone who was a friend or a relative (who was a Tiger). This was a movement that touched everybody in some way,” he says. That history gives Colombo carte blanche to harass and intimidate anyone on ‘national security grounds.’</p>
<p>“The Tamil people are being told that no-one is going to help you, the international community is not going to come in, this government is not going to change so you have to learn to live with the army.” Guruparan says.</p>
<p>“The real danger for me is people will learn way to cope with living with the army, that this will become normal as it is clear the army has no intention of going away.”</p>

The streets of Jaffna, traditional Tamil territory in Sri Lanka’s north-east, where now there is reportedly one army soldier for every 11 people.    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>IN Jaffna, I meet with Daya Master, the Tigers’ former propaganda ‘minister,’ their one-time official spokesman. In April 2009, a month before the war ended, he walked out of the jungle to surrender to government forces in what was one of the conflict’s most spectacular defections. A month later he was back in battle, this time helicoptered onto the battlefield by the government to  identify the corpse of Vellupillai Prabhakaran, the feared Tiger leader. Daya Master was one of the few Tigers close to him still alive who could.</p>
<p>“There was no purpose in fighting,” he says. “The LTTE was weakened, no arms, no shells, no manpower. It was finished.”</p>
<p>Today, Daya Master has been rehabilitated as a candidate for Sri Lanka’s ruling party in upcoming northern provincial elections. “I think I have a chance,” he says. “I want to help the people, the only way to help them is in the government. The people supported the LTTE for their political rights. Then the war finished. What is the alternative? The government is the only alternative.”</p>
<p>Back in the day, Daya Master was the go-to-guy for foreign officials and press visiting Eelam, as the Tigers’ de facto state was known. He joined the Tigers in the 1980s, though now he claims he was ‘just’ an employee, becoming a formal member in 2005. I met him in Kilinochchi, the Tigers’ capital, in 2003 when the Tigers and the government were in uneasy peace talks after an oft-broken Norwegian-brokered ceasefire.</p>
<p>Today, he’s a free man working as the ‘news director’ of a government-friendly TV channel broadcasting to Tamil communities, a propaganda position near identical to the one he performed for the Tigers for decades. “Yes, same job, different organisation, different way,” he says.</p>
<p>Daya Master leafs through a gallery of photographs I took across Eelam in 2003. There are shots of the Tigers’ myriad ‘martyrs’ cemeteries’ of their fallen soldiers, and the house where Tiger leader Prabhakaran was born, which had become a shrine. After the war, the government bulldozed them all. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12668613</p>

<p>“All these destroyed,” he says….. “gone….all gone,” he Daya Master.</p>

<p>He instantly recognises the old Tiger headquarters in their former capital, Kilinochchi, south of here. “This is my bunker!” he exclaims. There’s a photo of his assistant, a young man wearing the cyanide-filled suicide capsule necklace all Tigers were required to wear. “My boys!” he says “Gone, gone.”</p>

    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“The LTTE fought for the Tamil people’s rights, that is no doubt, but time to time their strategy should have changed.”</p>
<p>“It was futile, no? It was a mistake,” he says, albeit one that him took 30 years of profound involvement and a frightening month of bombardment for him to realise. “We lost many lives. What was the outcome of that? Nothing…for 30 years…..100,000 people we lost, no achievement, nothing. There were so many dead bodies lying on the ground. Innocent people, not all Tigers.” He says there were 300,000-400,000 people caught in the crossfire at war’s end, with no proper water, food or protection.</p>
<p>And what of ‘Prabha,’ the Tiger supremo? Was he the mad tyrant, as government propaganda portrays him? Even today, Daya Master seems reluctant to condemn his former leader. “If only he changed his way from time to time….”</p>
<p>I ask who killed Rajiv Gandhi, the much-loved Indian Prime Minister assassinated in 1991 by a Tiger suicide bomber in retaliation for India’s entry into the civil war. I’d asked him the same question in 2003, when he steadfastly denied any Tiger involvement.</p>
<p>Ten years on, with the Tigers vanquished and Daya Master angling for political office for the forces that defeated his once-beloved LTTE, he still struggles to answer, pausing before positing “the Tigers?”</p>
<p>I tell him why I’m asking. He cackles with laughter. “That’s the difference!”</p>
<p>And what happened to the Tigers’ international business empire - from mobile phone companies to petrol stations - estimated to be worth $3-4 billion and generating $200-300 million a year for their war machine? The Tigers even had a central bank, the Bank of Tamil Eelam, which in 2005 boasted foreign reserves of $500 million. Rumours have swirled Sri Lanka that government officials privately purloined the assets in the end-of-war chaos, or that they form a new fighting fund for a re-emergent Tigers among the Tamil diaspora. Some have pointed an accusing finger at the slippery Daya Master.</p>
<p>“The money-handling people at the time, they vanished with the money,” he says.</p>
<p>I ask him why his fellow Tamils are getting on boats. “Our political leaders,” he says....“so far they have not given the hope of prevailing peace here….our politicians so far have not shown a good way to them. They are losing this opportunity to peace.”</p>
<p>“The second (reason) is economic. If they give hope to the youngsters, why do they need to go there?</p>
