      <section>
        <p>Four years on from its brutal victory over Tamil Tiger rebels that ended a 26-year-long separatist war, Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese-led government is at pains to persuade the world that it has at last brought peace to this island.</p>
        <p>And the captain of Sri Lankan Airlines flight 423 from Bangkok seems keen to do his national bit, and convince his passengers that is so.</p>
        <p>As he eases his Airbus over the tea-studded hills of the island’s central highlands for a final approach into Colombo, the pilot readies his crew for landing, and primes his passengers too.</p>
        <p>“And a warm welcome to Paradise for all our passengers….” he intones in a voice as rich as chocolate. “That is, welcome to Paradise Regained.”</p>
        <p>Which it certainly is if you’ve holidayed in a splendid villa by its pristine beaches, arguably the best in Asia. And if you’re a member of the triumphalist Rajapakse clan who’ve ruled Sri Lanka since 2005 and are positioning for another generation yet. And for their mostly Sinhalese business cronies and chums enjoying easy access to the lucrative reconstruction deals that’s spurring a modest economic boom in the wake of battle.</p>
        <p>But, as The Global Mail will examine in a series looking at what peace is like in post-war Sri Lanka, the notion of paradise is moot for many on the island who aren’t tourists, or lavishing at the government’s borrowed teat.</p>
        <p>The war’s end has unleashed a rampant Sinhalese nationalism that has many of the country’s Tamils - a community numbering around 15 per cent of the 21 million population – fearful they are being subject to ‘structural genocide’ by the mostly Sinhalese government armed with generational plans to breed Hindu-Tamil culture off the island.</p>
        <p>Sri Lanka’s 10 per cent of so-called Moors, Tamil-speaking Muslims descended from Arabs who traded and settled here from the 7th Century and who in recent years of conflict were a mostly neutral voice of moderation, are also worried. They feel victimised and threatened by the outbreak of base chauvinism let loose by the Rajapakses, who draw their support from the semi-literate rural poor of the Sinhalese south.</p>
        <p>Among the Sinhalese community, its moderates and intellectuals worry that the values and liberties of their unique ‘masala’ nation that they cherish, that South Asia’s only uninterrupted democracy is being turned into a dynastic ‘mafia state’ as the Rajapaksas muzzle dissenting voices in the media and civil society.</p>
        <p>We begin our series in Colombo, where the raffish capital is in urgent economic catch-up mode, replacing the colonial-era roads and railways built when Churchill was a boy and ‘Ceylon’ was a languid tropical afterthought for the British Raj that ruled the plantation island with a police force despatched from India.</p>
        <p>Today, a sparkling new tollway to the beachy Rajapakse belt in the south has cut the journey time from a congested 3-4 hours to a hassle-free one. Further east, in President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s home region of Hambantota, Beijing has built an expansive new port, airport and cricket stadium in the country’s biggest infrastructural complex, a $1 billion development alongside the new convention centre built by Seoul. Now that shells have stopped falling in the conflict-ravaged north, Indian engineers are reinstating the civil war-severed train line that once carried passengers from Colombo to Jaffna.</p>
        <p>In the buzzy capital, still one of Asia’s poorest, its Rajapaksa-linked business community is re-arranging the skyline on borrowed money, studding new skyscrapers of hip hotels and soaring towers to be filled with people like Australia’s James Packer, who has teamed with a Rajapakse crony to build a $350 million casino complex here.</p>
        <p>Colombo’s port is a riot of re-development, as Beijing seeds yet another of its strategic ‘string of pearls’ around the Indian Ocean, with plans for a Dubai-style ‘Port City’ on land reclaimed from the sea that will, ambitiously, include a Formula One circuit – yet another one.</p>
        <p>But of the many towers now poking through Colombo’s fast-fading colonial vista, few have gone up as fast or been lavished with as much official attention as the Sri Sambuddhathva Jayanthi Mandiraya, the temple now soaring over Colombo’s leafy southern suburbs.</p>
        <p>Opened in 2011, just two years after the war ended, the complex owned claims to be the world’s biggest repository of Buddhist texts. What it doesn’t so much advertise is that it also the headquarters of a shadowy ultra-Buddhist activist group called Bodu Bala Sena.</p>
        <p>That’s the “Army of Buddhist Power” which was founded in May last year when the militant fringes of the main religious party in Sri Lanka, the Jathika Hela Urumaya, or the National Heritage Party, broke away because they felt the JHU was too moderate.</p>
        <p>Since then, the BBS has emerged post-war as the self-proclaimed true protector of Buddhism on the island. Sri Lanka may be at peace, with the Sinhalese Buddhist authorities in command and a pious Buddhist in the presidency, but to hear the BBS hierachy tell it, Buddhism and Sri Lanka have never been more at risk.</p>
        <p>Social Integration Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara has described it as ‘extremist.’ Prominent Lankan diplomat Dayan Jayatilleka says it is an “ethno-religious fascist movement from the dark underside of Sinhala society” while the island’s most prominent Buddhist intellectual, the Venerable Professor Belanwila Wimalaratana Anunayake has dissociated Sri Lanka’s sangha, the mainstream Buddhist clergy, from BBS’ extremism.</p>
        <p>Part vigilante, part religious police, the BBS has specifically targeted Muslim practices and businesses here, often with little police intervention. BBS members have claimed Muslims dominate Sri Lanka’s business community, foment religious fundamentalism while their doctors secretly sterilise Sinhalese women.</p>
        <p>The rise of militant monks in Sri Lanka, which has mirrored similar developments in reformist Burma and elsewhere in South-East Asia, has particularly sinister overtones here.</p>
        <p>One of Sri Lanka’s most controversial of post-colonial leaders, Solomon Bandaranaike, was assassinated in 1959 by a Buddhist monk who felt betrayed that Bandaranaike’s pro-Sinhalese policies – that many Lankans believe led to the separatist Tamil uprising in the north-east – didn’t go far enough, though there is also a concurrent view that the assassin was hired by a senior monk avenging the loss of business opportunities.</p>
        <p>“We felt that Buddhism is not protected in this country and Buddhists face a big danger, locally as well as internationally,” the BBS insists, the BBS’ layman ‘chief executive’ and ‘program co-ordinator’ of its ‘Buddhist Leadership Academy’ Dilanthe Withanage told The Global Mail.</p>
        <p>Many Sri Lankans believe the BBS to be a creation of the government, in particular of President Rajapaksa’s brother Gotabaya, Sri Lanka’s unelected Defence Secretary and the mastermind of the 2009 victory over the mostly Hindu Tamil rebels. Gotabaya has denied any involvement in the BBS’ emergence.</p>
        <p>“We don’t have any political influence,” the BBS Withanage claims.</p>
        <p>But if the president’s scheming brother is not an architect of the BBS, Gotabaya seems at the very least a patron. In March he officiated at the opening of a BBS office in Galle, one of Sri Lanka’s more Islamic of cities.</p>
        <p>“Gotabaya came to open something donated by a German fellow to the Buddhist Cultural Centre. We’ve decided to use this facility as a training centre.”</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, When Milinda Moragoda, an erstwhile presidential advisor and leading figure in Colombo’s civil society lobby, brokered a cross-religious community deal over cattle slaughter.</p>
        <p>Buddhist and Muslim leaders linked hands in a public display of unity http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev98ftft_uk but the Moragoda deal fell short of the blanket ban on halal certification demanded by a militant BBS. It said Moragoda had created “an unholy inter-religious alliance, and attempting to destroy our learned monks (who were) now in the grasp of infidels." These monks, lamented the BBS, “were pseudo Buddhist leaders who never stood against Muslim extremism and Christian fundamentalism.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“RELIGION is a private thing,” Withanage tells The Global Mail, and many conflict-weary Lankans would agree.</p>
        <p>But in recent months Withanage’s group have chosen to make some very public religious protests.</p>
        <p>In January, the BBS hierachy got hold of a menu for a private dinner at a resort hotel south of Colombo favoured by French tourists and owned by Sri Lanka’s biggest company, the John Keells Holdings.</p>
        <p>From IT and banks to plantations, hotels and retail, Keells is a sprawling enterprise, and one as yet untainted by the expanding corporate grasp of the ruling Rajapakse clan.</p>
        <p>Keells’ chairman is Susantha Ratnayake, who also chairs the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, which had also brokered the halal meat deal with Moragoda and the various religious lobbies. Ratnayake and the CCC had been in the BBS’ crosshairs, claiming they ‘fail to safeguard’ Buddhist business interests on the island.</p>
        <p>The hotel document obtained by the BBS described the atmospherics planned by hospitality staff for the dinner, describing the meal as ‘nirvana’ with a ‘cosy Buddha Bar lounge’ feel. For the French holidaymakers, it seemed designed to evoke the music and food phenomenon http://www.buddhabar.com/en/ from Paris that, fashionably fused by DJ Claude Challe, became the chill-out soundtrack of the 2000s for international hipsters from Bali to Budapest.</p>
        <p>But the BBS were anything but chilled. An orange army of militant monks led by its secretary-general, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, stormed the hotel, demanding and succeeding in getting its management carted off to the police charged with ‘hurting religious feelings.’</p>
        <p>The BBS moved on the hotel, says Withanage, “because of the alcohol, the dancing, the behaviour.”</p>
        <p>“Why do they use the menu ‘Nirvana’?” Withanage rails. “The name Buddha should be used appropriately. We should respect any religion. The context is different, it’s not appropriate to use in a hotel, in the evening party.”</p>
        <p>“The ‘Jesus Bar’ may hurt some Christians,” he says.</p>
        <p>Despite being a self-appointed guardian of the public morals, the BBS isn’t fussed by the plethora of casinos in Sri Lanka, many owned by business associates of the Rajapakse clan, including a government-approved $US350 million development planned by local tycoon Ravi Wijeratne and Australian Kerry Packer, on a prime downtown Colombo site adjacent to Sri Lanka’s oldest Hindu temple.</p>
        <p>“Lord Buddha is not against anything,” says Withanage. “He never asked kings to stop things. In Sri Lanka, there are a couple of casinos. No-one protested about them. But when this Australian guy wanted to start, they all talk about casinos. What we (BBS) said was if we attack that person, we should attack the other parties also. If we want to stop casinos, it’s everybody. We should not attack only one casino because that turns us into being against investment. If you against casinos you should be against all casinos in the country.”</p>
        <p>“Personally, I think it is better that we don’t have gambling but we (BBS) don’t have any problem with it.”</p>
        <p>The BBS would like Buddhism to be Sri Lanka’s official state religion. The current constitution, passed in 1978, holds that Sri Lanka is a secular state guaranteeing its citizens freedom of religion, with Buddhism holding the “foremost place.” There is no mention of Hinduism, Islam or Christianity in the document.</p>
        <p>The BBS claims Buddhism was the island’s state religion before the British colonised ‘Ceylon,’ after deposing its Kandyan aristocracy in 1815.</p>
        <p>“We think whatever we had before British should come back,” he says. That being so, the Hinduism as practised by most of the island’s Tamils, around 11-12 per cent of its population, would make a historical comeback. Hinduism has been practiced in vast numbers on the island for millennia – it presence on the island is even mentioned in Hinduism’s epic tract, the Ramayana, circa the 4th century BCE/BC. Hinduism was also the state religion of the Jaffna Kingdom in the north of the island that fell to the Portuguese in 1624, pre-dating British occupation.)</p>
        <p>But that doesn’t seem to factor in the BBS’s history books. Withanage rules out Hinduism as a co-state religion in Sri Lanka, and Islam and Christianity too. “Before the British came into this country, Buddhism was the state religion so therefore Buddhism should be the state religion … provided all other religions have due respect and freedom to practice.”</p>
        <p>At this point, a tall 40-something man in a luxuriant vermillion robe enters the room, exuding authority while furiously tapping into an iPad. The BBS' layman chief executive Dilanthe Withanage stops mid-sentence to genuflect at him. I recognise the man as Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, one of the BBS founders, its secretary-general.</p>
        <p>Withanage introduces us and we continue our discussion about Sri Lankan Buddhism. I ask them why they see their faith as under threat on an island where ethnic Sinhalese Buddhists like them comprise around 75 per cent of its 20 million people, when the president is a very publicly devout Buddhist and champion of the faith and when Sri Lanka’s other ethnic and religious groups are very much a minority.</p>
        <p>Withanage calmly denies that the Bodi Bala Sena attacked a prominent Muslim-owned fashion chain in suburban Colombo, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KCQwarwfN4 as was widely reported in Sri Lanka, even in the government-owned media.</p>
        <p>Gnanasara suddenly turns very angry, hardly the demeanour one expects of a pious Buddhist monk. Withanage's previous, moderated explanations of BBS activism give way to a bilious Gnanasara railing at the mere mention of Muslims and Islam, indeed seemingly of anyone who isn't a Buddhist.</p>
        <p>“Don’t talk with us,” he yells. “Any Muslims, they are very bad people here. They are creating all problems here.”</p>
        <p>All Muslims? I ask.</p>
        <p>“Yes, all Muslims same. No chance here. We want to stop this extremist work of Muslims. They are not going to destroy our culture. Buddhist people are very peaceful.”</p>
        <p>Dilanthe Withanage chimes in. “Muslims are living peacefully, Muslims have all facilities here. The mayor of Colombo is a Muslim,” Withanage declares. “Do you allow in your country a Muslim to be a mayor?”</p>
        <p>Yes, I answer, Australia has a number of elected public officials who are Muslim.</p>
        <p>But Withanage is unconvinced. “The governor of this province is a Muslim so you can’t say Muslims can’t live peacefully?” He says.</p>
        <p>I remind him that I didn’t say that, but his boss, the BBS secretary-general Gnanasara, did barely a minute earlier, insisting that all Muslims were bad. I ask Gnarasara about Hindus? Christians? Foreigners? Does the BBS have any problems with them?</p>
        <p>“We are against only extremist groups, and fundamentalists,” he says.</p>
        <p>What about Buddhist fundamentalists, I ask?</p>
        <p>“Where?” Gnanasara asks.</p>
        <p>“Maybe here?” I ask. I cite the remarks of various prominent Sri Lankans in civil society circles, such as the diplomat and intellectual Dayan Jayatilleka and politician Milinda Moragoda, who have publicly condemned BBS extremism.</p>
        <p>“They are mad people,” he says. “Very bad people. They get funding from various people, Christian and other groups, to speak against Buddha, with NGOs.”</p>
        <p>So Jayatilleka, a career diplomat and Sri Lanka's former UN ambassador, and former Minister Morogoda are mad?</p>
        <p>“A very bad man he is,” snarls Gnanasara. “They are funded. You look at their background. Are they Buddhist? There are some groups created by the church and they want to destroy Buddhist culture. His (Jayatilleka’s) background is not Buddhist, Milinda is not Buddhist.”</p>
        <p>Is President Rajapakse a good Buddhist? I ask. His brother Gotabaya, the Defence Secretary?</p>
        <p>Gnanasara pauses, and smiles. “Yes, yes,” he says, his anger now lightening. His (President Rajapaksa’s) wife is a Catholic, no?</p>
        <p>I think so, I say. Is that a problem?</p>
        <p>“Very good,” he offers. “No problem.”</p>
        <p>Translating Gnanasara's Sinhala into English, Withanage says Western media and other foreigners "like to attack Sri Lanka because we are a poor people, we are a small country, threatened by international pressures, and media, because you have money, you can travel. We would also like to come and interview your Prime Minister but we don’t have money and you have enough money to do that.”</p>
        <p>“International media … have an agenda to destroy Buddhism and show the world that Buddhists are extremists but when your Prime Minister talks about extremist ideas in Australia no-one talk about these things. Please fund us, so we can show that.”</p>
        <p>“We don’t trust the foreign media,” says Gnanasara. “Most of you come with hidden agendas. A lot of false information about BBS is spreading around the world.”</p>
        <p>The latest media to upset them is Xinhua, the state newsagency from China, which has essentially kept the Rajapakse regime afloat since 2005, financing huge white elephant infrastructure projects in the president’s home region of Hambantota, while providing much of the military materiel used by his military to conquer the Tigers.</p>
        <p>On July 8, Xinhua reported that BBS demanded a hijab ban in Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-07/08/c_132522945.htm</p>
        <p>But the Chinese are wrong, claims Withanage. Citing similar laws in Europe, he says the BBS aren’t seeking a specific ban on hijabs in Sri Lanka but a general public ban on anyone covering their faces. “We also don’t need that here,” he insists.</p>
        <p>That about the only Sri Lankans culturally inclined to cover their faces on the island are members of its Muslim community is incidental, he claims, a mere coincidence. “This has nothing to do with religious matters,” he insists. “We never talk about the hijab. We don’t have any problem with that.”</p>
        <p>I ask Withanage why the BBS has massed protests outside the Indian High Commission in Colombo. “Because India should protect Buddhist heritage,” he says.</p>
        <p>What hasn’t India done? I ask.</p>
        <p>Withanage cites the July 7 bombing at the holy site in Bodhgaya in the Indian state of Bihar, which has been blamed by various South Asian politicians, without compelling evidence, on Islamists from India and Pakistan, extremist Hindus, India’s militant Maoists and, by Sri Lanka's Prime Minister, on diaspora remnants of Sri Lanka’s defeated Tamil Tiger separatists.</p>
        <p>“This is the birthplace of Buddha,” Withanage says. “And it should be protected.”</p>
        <p>But there’s a problem with his assertion, a rather alarming and possibly revealing one, mindful that the BBS styles itself as Sri Lanka’s truest protector of the Buddhist faith. (Bodu Bala Sena literally translates from Sinhala as ‘the Army of Buddhist Power’)</p>
        <p>Bodhgaya isn’t Lord Buddha’s birthplace, as even the humblest pious Buddhist would know. It’s widely agreed that Gautama was born in present-day Nepal. Religious archaeologists have cited a number of other locations in India and Nepal as his birthplace, but none of them are in Bihar.</p>
        <p>To Buddhists, Bodhgaya is where Gautama attained enlightenment. The holy site in Bihar may be regarded as the place where Buddhism was founded, but that’s a very different thing to the BBS’ position, and why it has been laying siege to the Indian mission.</p>
        <p>I ask him if Tamil, the mother tongue of the island’s Hindu Tamil and Muslim communities, should be an official language alongside the Sinhala spoken by Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese Buddhists, around 70-75 per cent of the population. It was the Sinhala Only Act of 1956, enacted soon after the then Ceylon attained independence from London, which failed to officially recognise the Tamil tongue spoken by around 25 per cent of the population that many Lankans believe led to the long-running separatist war in the Tamil north.)</p>
        <p>Four years after that war ended, and with triumphant Sinhalese nationalism rampant, the language issue has again reared on the island, with noises from the Rajapakse regime it wants to dilute the so-called ‘13th Amendment’ of the constitution that guarantees Tamil equal status with Sinhala as an official language.</p>
        <p>Gnanasara fudges an answer. “I think you need to understand history … you can’t just ask questions like this.” Withanage chimes in again; “we don’t have any issue with Tamils. Next month we will organise a large number of rallies in Tamil areas. The Tamil people want us there. We have never killed Tamils. We killed terrorists.”</p>
        <p>The monks wind up the interview, they have travel to Kandy, the ancient aristocratic capital, to undertake. As I prepare to leave, Gnanansara barks brief and urgent instructions to Withanage in Sinhala, before Withanage catches up on my way out.</p>
        <p>“When he said that all Muslims are bad...” explains Withanage “...that was a joke. We don’t have anything against Muslims.” He claims Gnanansara remark that all Muslim were bad was my fault, simply because I asked him about it.</p>
        <p>Sri Lanka has a long way to go.</p>
